//Step 1: Install VS Code
//Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.
//Step 2: Install GCC
//Install the GCC compiler suite. This typically involves using a package manager (e.g., apt on Linux, Homebrew on macOS, or MinGW/WSL on Windows).
//The command to install might look like:
//sudo apt update
//sudo apt install build-essential
//Step 3: Configure VS Code
//Install the "C/C++" extension in VS Code. Configure the tasks.json and launch.json files to use the GCC compiler and debugger.
//Step 4: Write a C program
//Create a new file (e.g., hello.c) and write a simple C program.
//Step 5: Compile and run the program
//Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and compile the program using GCC:
//gcc hello.c -o hello
//Then run the executable:
//./hello
